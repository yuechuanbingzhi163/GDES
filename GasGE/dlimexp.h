//----- Note: we don't use __declspec(dllimport) here, because of the
//----- "local vtable" problem with msvc. If you use __declspec(dllimport),
//----- then, when a client dll does a new on the class, the object's
//----- vtable pointer points to a vtable allocated in that client
//----- dll. If the client dll then passes the object to another dll,
//----- and the client dll is then unloaded, the vtable becomes invalid
//----- and any virtual calls on the object will access invalid memory.
//-----
//----- By not using __declspec(dllimport), we guarantee that the
//----- vtable is allocated in the server dll during the ctor and the
//----- client dll does not overwrite the vtable pointer after calling
//----- the ctor. And, since we expect the server dll to remain in
//----- memory indefinitely, there is no problem with vtables unexpectedly
//----- going away.
